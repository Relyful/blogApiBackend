## BlogAPI backend

BlogAPI backend is my first try at creating RESTful API, this API allows me to create users, blogs and comments with CRUD capability. 
There is also a user [frontend](https://github.com/Relyful/blogApiFrontend) and [admin frontend](https://github.com/Relyful/blogApiAdminFrontend) made with react.
This project is using Postgres Database with Prisma Orm. Authentication is handled with passport using local and jwt strategies.
This project also taught me about importance of setting up correct cors policy.
