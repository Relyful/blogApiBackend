## BlogAPI Backend

This is my first attempt at creating a RESTful API. It supports creating users, blogs, and comments with full CRUD functionality.  
The project includes a [user frontend](https://github.com/Relyful/blogApiFrontend) and an [admin frontend](https://github.com/Relyful/blogApiAdminFrontend), both built with React.  
It uses a PostgreSQL database managed through Prisma ORM. Authentication is handled with Passport using local and JWT strategies.  
This project also taught me the importance of properly configuring CORS policies.

### Built With

- Passport
